Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you my project on Sudoku Solver as part of my internship with Prodigy InfoTech, I had the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into Sudoku game.
In this project, I used Python as the programming language. I have used PyCharm Community to execute the program.

I had a great time working on this project and gained as well as learned a lot in the process. I hope it piques your interest in this game!
